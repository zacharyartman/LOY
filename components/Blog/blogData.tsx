    title: "Ayurveda: The Science of Life",
    metadata: `<p><strong>What is Ayurveda </strong></p>
<p>Ayurveda is a holistic, natural practice of medicine that originated in India more than 4,000 years ago and one that is still practiced widely today. Because Ayurveda involves subtle daily lifestyle choices, it can often be used in conjunction with any modern medicine approach, though you should always check with your healthcare provider prior to engaging in any lifestyle change. When translated from its original Sanskrit form, Ayurveda can be interpreted as “the science of life”. Rather than focusing solely on treating diseases after they occur, Ayurveda is based on the idea of living in harmony with yourself and with nature daily to prevent mental and physical imbalances, which lead to disease. Sometimes referred to as “the sister science of yoga”, Ayurveda recommends a regular practice of unity among mind, body, spirit, and nature to maintain optimal health. According to the practice of Ayurveda, mental health, as well as spiritual health, are equally as important as physical health in living a truly healthy life. You can achieve optimal whole-body health by engaging in daily practices that include morning and nighttime rituals that align with the rhythms of nature, meditation, movement and eating habits that are rooted in Ayurvedic tradition. The theory of Ayurveda is based on the existence of, and maintaining balance between, five elements: space/ether, air/wind, fire, water, and earth. The sages of Ayurveda synthesized these into three categories, which are now called doshas. According to Ayurveda, every human being has a predominant dosha or combination of doshas. Each dosha has its own natural inclinations, such as the tendency to be airy, fiery, earthy, or a combination of any of these. The goal of Ayurveda is to maintain balance among your individual dosha(s) through daily practices to cultivate a life of whole-body health. According to Ayurveda, maintaining this balance daily has the potential to result in optimal health in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>What are the Doshas? </strong></p>
<p>There are three doshas in Ayurveda: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each of these doshas is comprised of a combination of elements. Vata is made up of air and ether/space, fire and water come together to form Pitta, and Kapha consists of the coupling of earth and water. Our predominant dosha type can influence everything from our physical bodies to our unconscious mental states. This is why Ayurveda calls for specific daily practices relating to the foods we eat, the exercises we engage in, and to the types of meditations and rituals we practice. All of these may vary widely from person to person. Read on to understand a little more about each dosha.</p>
<p><u>Vata</u></p>
<p>Due to the airy nature of this dosha, people who are predominantly Vata may be hyperactive, naturally slim, creative, may experience physical dryness, and may get cold more easily than other dosha types. If out of balance, Vata people may experience hypertension, digestive issues, weight loss, anxiety, insomnia, and forgetfulness. However, when in balance, Vatas can be exceptionally agile, creative, energetic, and flexible. Certain Ayurvedic rituals and practices can be used to keep a Vata person in balance. For example, since Vata people tend to be naturally energetic, a calming yoga practice or gentle meditation session may be more beneficial for this dosha type than a more rigorous activity. Additionally, because Vata people are naturally “airy”, foods that are warming and grounding should be prioritized, such as warm vegetable soup. Morning and evening rituals should also be warming and grounding for this dosha type, such as gentle self-massage, the use of warming oils, and grounding movement.</p>
<p><u>Pitta</u></p>
<p>Influenced by the elements of fire and water, Pitta people tend to be muscular with medium athletic builds, they tend to be slightly more competitive than the other two doshas, are generally assertive, driven, and are typically intellectual. As naturally hard workers, they may be at a greater risk of burnout. When out of balance, Pitta people may experience skin rashes, excessive body heat and sweating, short tempers, indigestion, and a propensity toward rigidity and anger. However, when in balance, Pitta people may have a lustrous complexion, healthy digestion, they may be sharp and precise, and are excellent leaders. Unlike Vata people, who are naturally “cool”, Pittas are fiery and Ayurvedic practices tend to be more cooling for this dosha. For example, it is recommended that Pitta people avoid hot chilies, which may overstimulate their natural hot tendencies. Instead, foods like cucumbers, bitter greens, and legumes are recommended for Pittas, as they are cooling in nature. Pitta people should engage in rituals that are cooling to the mind and body. When out of balance, yoga in a cool room can be a balancing exercise for Pitta people.</p>
<p><u>Kapha </u></p>
<p>The Kapha dosha is made up of earth and water elements. Because of this combination, Kapha people tend to have solid physical builds, they radiate calming energy that is warm and welcoming, they are often described as having a laid-back attitude, and they can be exceptionally reliable partners or friends. When Kapha people are out of balance, they may experience weight gain, slow digestion, excessive tiredness, depression, and may be resistant to change. When in balance, Kapha people may have smooth supple skin, thick hair, excellent stamina, and are generally patient and supportive. Due to the steady and stable nature of this dosha, Ayurveda calls for regular movement, stimulating activities and rituals, and the consumption of light dry foods for Kapha types. A vigorous yoga class may be more beneficial for this dosha than a calming yoga class. Because Kapha people tend to be heavy sleepers, creating a morning routine that involves waking up around 6 am may result in maximized energy for this dosha.</p>
<p><strong>Your Individualized Day-to-Day Wellness Plan for Long Term Health </strong></p>
<p>While every human being is different and specific practices and rituals will vary according to individual doshas, Ayurveda sets the foundation for creating daily routines that optimize wellness for anyone who practices it. Ayurvedic practices have stood the test of time because they are largely intuitive and just make sense. For example, if you are feeling cold and anxious, some part of you knows that reaching for a calming cup of warm tea will help bring you back to homeostasis. However, since we live in a world that is becoming increasingly fast-paced, overstimulating, and even further removed from nature, it can be exceptionally difficult to tune into our own intuition at any given time. Like yoga, Ayurvedic practices have the potential to deepen our connection to ourselves and to the world around us. By engaging daily in simple Ayurvedic routines and rituals that allow for your body and mind to harmonize with nature, healthy choices will come naturally and intuitively over time. Understanding your dosha is the first step in creating your own personalized and sustainable wellness plan. Want to take that first step?

    title: "Setting Intentions: What is it and Why do it in a Yoga Class?",
    metadata: `<p><strong>Demystifying Intention Setting </strong></p>
<p>You may have found yourself racing into a yoga class, ready to move and sweat, only to be asked to take a moment to slow your mind and then invited to set an intention prior to beginning your sweat session. This may catch you off guard and leave you wondering what your intention for the class should be. Modern yoga classes are often rife with the notion of ‘intention setting’, but it’s not always clear what that means. Setting an intention first requires you to tune into your deepest hopes and aspirations that lie just beyond your conscious awareness. Using that information, you can create a guideline for living that allows you to align your daily actions to your ‘highest self’. In other words, intention setting requires that you quiet your mind to find out which personal values or qualities you can instill in your daily life that will lead to true happiness. Rather than being goal oriented or becoming attached to specific outcomes, intention setting allows you to gently focus on your own personal values without judgment. Some examples of such values that may be used in intention setting include mindfulness, forgiveness, presence, gratitude, love, resilience, inner strength, stability, letting go of negativity or acceptance. Intention setting in a yoga class may look different for everyone and it may differ for you personally from one class to the next, depending on where you are in your life. Maybe you are someone who struggles with trying to maintain control over every aspect of your life. Perhaps this is interfering with your contentment on a day-to-day basis. Your intention for the class may be one of letting go of control or that of acceptance. In the context of yoga, this may look like accepting that you aren’t as flexible today as you may have been in the previous class. Because yoga is centered around mindfully aligning your mind, body, and spirit, it is the perfect place to cultivate such awareness. You may find yourself revisiting that awareness and reminding yourself of your intention throughout your day.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>The Science Behind Intention Setting in Yoga</strong></p>
<p>Intention setting and mindfulness have been used for centuries in Eastern traditions. Recently, the practice has been backed by researchers in the field of psychology and neuroscience. Dan Siegel, a renown psychiatrist and bestselling author, is a staunch supporter of the practice of mindfulness and intention setting. According to Siegel, by regularly engaging in these practices, the mindset shifts they foster become an automatic aspect of your <a href="https://drdansiegel.com/book/the-mindful-therapist/">personality</a>. It all starts with consciously setting an intention that aligns with the deepest, most authentic part of your psyche. By regularly recalling that intention and orienting your own mindset and behaviors around such intention, actualizing that intention gradually happens automatically. The more you do it, the less effort it requires. Some people call this manifesting. It may sound like a new-age concept, but it’s actually backed by neuroscience. Science also supports the notion that intention setting in a yoga class is especially beneficial. Social psychologists embrace the concept of embodiment, which refers to the assumption that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are grounded in sensory experiences and bodily <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01212.x">states</a>. In other words, because yoga invites you to move your body while you recall certain thoughts, feelings, and behaviors you wish to manifest, you are more likely to adopt such mental orientations. What’s more is that when you orient your mind toward more positive and flexible thinking, which yoga helps to cultivate, your mind’s potential for transcendence becomes even more <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/broaden-build-theory/">likely</a>. Arnold Schwarzenegger once said, “where the mind goes, the body will follow”. If that’s true, yoga has the potential to make both your mind and body capable of wondrous things!</p>
<p><strong>Taking your Intention off the Mat </strong></p>
<p>With their practice of sankalpa, the ancient Vedic Rishi’s seemed to be really good at living mindfully and with intention. For many of us modern folks, finding the time to slow down and tune into our highest selves may not occur as often as we’d like. Yoga is the ideal place to nurture such awareness and plant the seeds of change we wish to sow in our lives. Think about it; from the moment you wake up and until you close your eyes at night, there is so much that needs to be done. Intention setting may not make the cut for what ‘has’ to get accomplished in a day. However, because movement is essential for your health, perhaps your schedule allows for a block of time that can be reserved for yoga. By giving yourself this time, you grant yourself the opportunity to move and flow in ways that go far beyond just your physical body. By setting an intention at the beginning of each yoga class, you allow yourself the space to reflect on the ways in which you want to think and behave in your life. When you leave your yoga class, you can tap into this intention throughout the day. If you do this enough, over time, this type of orienting of your mind will flow into every aspect of your life. Science has shown that this has the potential to increase your happiness and well-being substantially.</p>
<p>While the tendency for humans to go on autopilot has certainly served its purpose in contributing to the survival of the human race, it can sometimes get in the way of living mindfully and purposefully. Mindfulness and acceptance are two of the many benefits that a practitioner of yoga may experience. With the help of yoga, we can view our own inclinations to go on autopilot from a place of gratitude and non-judgment. This will allow you to gracefully return from a straying mind back to a mind that aligns with your intention, both on and off the mat. By making intention setting a regular part of your yoga practice, you may find that your mindset shift is making a positive impact on your overall life. Next time you are in a yoga class and are asked to set an intention, try taking advantage of the silence and stillness that is available to you in that moment. You may find yourself feeling happier and more content throughout the day. With enough practice, you may also notice that this positive mindset is showing up in many other aspects of your life.</p>

    title: "Unlocking the Mystery of Meditation",
    metadata: `<p><strong>What is Meditation? </strong></p>
<p>There is often a misconception about meditation that turns people off to the practice before even beginning. People often say things like “I don’t have time to meditate” or “I can’t turn my thoughts off”. Meditation may also be challenging for people who experience discomfort or anxiety in stillness (which, by the way, is most of us modern day humans). Because of this, it’s important to dispel the myth that, if you can’t sit still on a floor cushion in solitary meditation for a prolonged period of time (think of a Buddhist monk in a cave for months on end), you can’t meditate. This simply isn’t the case. The myth of sudden and immediate enlightenment in meditation should also be dispelled. While meditation can certainly lead to mental clarity and states of enlightenment, it doesn’t necessarily happen automatically. Like physical exercise, for meditation to be effective, it requires a consistent and deliberate practice. Also, like physical exercise, the challenge in meditation is a necessary component of the practice. Like Theodore Roosevelt once said, “nothing worth having comes easy”. This is also true in meditation.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the fact that meditation is a process that requires you to ‘show up’ time and time again, you still may be wondering what meditation actually is. Meditation is highly experiential and, therefore, it is difficult to define in words. However, it can be defined somewhat broadly in this way: Stated simply, meditation is a practice that involves an orienting of the mind in a particular way. Meditation has been used throughout the ages and all over the world to accomplish enhanced and enlightened mental states. There are many forms of meditation and meditation can be practiced in a variety of ways; so many that this article is nowhere near exhaustive in listing all forms and practices of meditation. Some forms of meditation, such as Samatha, are more calming in nature and promote the use of a singular pointed type of focus to nurture a sense of calm. Sometimes meditation can be focused on something external, such as a mandala, or internal, such as the breath. Meditation can involve the use of verbal repetition of some sort, such as in mantra meditation. Loving kindness meditation, which involves focusing your energy on cultivating a sense of compassion for yourself and for others, can be very effective in letting go of negative emotions. Meditation can also be more gradual and contemplative, such as in Vipassana meditation, where the meditator uses concentration to peel away the layers of illusion that may prevent someone from living life fully in the present moment. In addition to all the various styles of meditation we just listed, meditation can also be guided or unguided. In a guided meditation, a teacher, either in person or virtually, will guide you through a particular process. Quite often, the process involves a recognition of how the mind works during meditation, an acknowledgment of the thoughts that arise, an acceptance of the transient nature of thoughts, learning how to detach from those thoughts, and, eventually, engendering an ability to transfer those skills into everyday life. Over time and with practice, such guidance can help you to create your own practice that is self-initiated, or unguided.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation is Both Challenging and Rewarding </strong></p>
<p>If after reading about the different types of meditation, you are feeling even more lost and anxious, you are certainly not alone. Humans are hardwired to regularly engage in worrisome thoughts. The human brain evolved in such a way that encourages us to focus on negative emotions and thoughts. Back in the day of our hunter/gatherer ancestors, focusing on negative emotions and thoughts held more weight in terms of contributing to our survival than focusing on positive emotions and thoughts. In other words, humans were more likely to survive if they were more attuned to their fears of encountering, say, a venomous snake, than to their more positive mental inclinations. Luckily, we humans no longer need to rely on our worrisome thoughts. In fact, now that we have progressed as a human species, such thoughts have the potential to hinder human performance. On the contrary, meditation and mindfulness are often accompanied by states of flow, which can significantly improve your <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Flow/QVjPsd1UukEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover">performance</a>. Meditation has also been shown to improve cognition, promote positive emotions, slow down the process of aging in the brain, reverse symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), help with anxiety, and so many other brain related ailments. This is because meditation literally changes the <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/meditation/science-of-meditation/science-behind-being-present/">neurochemistry</a> and structure of your brain over time. So, while meditation can be challenging, it can also be exceptionally helpful in clearing the mind of worry and in alleviating all the mental health issues that humans are subject to. This all sounds great, doesn’t it? However, we still must reckon with the fact that meditation takes consistent practice and time. For many of us, time is a precious resource that is considerably limited. This is where yoga comes into play.</p>
<p><strong>Yoga and Meditation</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve ever found yourself plopping down onto a floor cushion after a hectic day, forcing yourself to quiet your mind (in an attempt to ‘meditate’), you may find it to be incredibly challenging; so challenging that you decide to give up before you even start. You wouldn’t be the first person to experience such difficulty and you certainly won’t be the last. As we have already discussed, simply quieting your mind can be exceptionally difficult. Doing so without warming up to it can be even more arduous. It turns out, this uniquely human problem, which was once helpful, isn’t new. In fact, the original yogis from India recognized this. It was understood that both the body and the mind had to be sufficiently primed before meditation could even begin. This understanding led to the birth of yoga. Yoga was created as a practice that would prepare the mind and body for seated meditation. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika, which was the first yoga manual written in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, lists Padmasana (lotus pose) as the very first yoga pose. Practicing this posture would allow meditators to sit comfortably for long periods of time without having to deal with the mental burden of <a href="https://www.yogapedia.com/from-the-lotus-the-history-and-benefits-of-padmasana/2/11515">discomfort</a>. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, which is a cornerstone text in the practice of yoga, describes eight limbs of <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/spirituality/eight-limbs-of-yoga/">yoga</a>; all of which are necessary in accessing samadhi, or bliss. It is said that once a practitioner reaches samadhi, they are able to transcend the Self, or ego. This is precisely what practitioners of meditation hope to accomplish. The eight limbs of yoga are described as limbs of a tree. As we mature and grow in our yoga practice, the tree of enlightenment will grow in due time. According to the Sutras of Patanjali, Dhyana, or meditation, is the seventh limb and can only occur once a practitioner has mastered the preceding limbs. These include Asana (physical posture), which is the third limb, Pranayama (breath control), which is the fourth limb, Pratyahara (sense withdrawal), which is the fifth limb, and Dharana (concentration), which is the sixth limb. In other words, in order to experience sense withdrawal and the ability to concentrate, which are necessary for practicing meditation, one must first practice movement and breath control. Stated another way, the practice of yoga makes meditation much more accessible. According to Patanjali, with a regular yoga practice, one can achieve all eight limbs.</p>
<p>Meditation doesn’t have to be this mysterious practice that is reserved only for monks. Have you ever found yourself lost in the flow of breath and movement in a yoga class? This is a form of meditation. Have you ever felt a sense of bliss while resting heavy in Savasana? This is also a form of meditation. Little moments of meditation such as these found in yoga are significant. They add up and cultivate an ability to find stillness in everyday life. After mindfully practicing yoga for a while, you may notice a shift in your mindset. You may find that you are able to sit in stillness for longer periods of time. Take advantage of your time in your yoga sessions to engender a capacity for meditative experiences. One way to do this is to really focus on linking your breath to your movement. Doing this will automatically lead to the growth of the other limbs of yoga that are necessary for meditation. As we have discussed, there are innumerable forms of meditation. If you are like most people in this fast-paced modern world, finding the time to train your mind to meditate can be challenging. Yoga is a great and practical place to begin your meditation practice!</p>`

    title: "Mala Beads: What They Are and How to Use Them",
    metadata: `<p><strong>What are Mala Beads </strong></p>
<p>Mala beads originated in India over 2500 years ago. The word ‘mala’ is Sanskrit for ‘meditation garland’. Just as there are many styles of meditation today, there were a multitude of meditation techniques that were used in ancient India. One type of meditation was called Japa meditation. In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_19v5dv2C78C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=mala+beads+japa&amp;ots=jB-y3gjVtS&amp;sig=iJI6NK4js55PjyXa0cLQHZc3FRw#v=onepage&amp;q=mala&amp;f=false">Japa</a> meditation, a meditator would recite or chant a mantra, either audibly or quietly. Japa meditation originated in the Vedic tradition of India, which shaped the practice of several Eastern religions. In Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, a mantra is something that is repeated a specific number of times. A mantra can be a sound or syllable that is repeated, such as Om, or it can be a calling out or honoring of a specific deity. While mantras and mala meditation were originally created in the context of religion, they can also be used by meditators who have no affiliation with any Eastern religions. In fact, the concept behind mala meditation is so universal, it can be found in many other religions. For example, mala beads are comparable to rosary beads, which are used in Roman Catholicism. In both practices, a practitioner uses the beads to keep track of how many times that person repeats a prayer or mantra.</p>
<p>Meditation has always been recognized as being ‘difficult’, even for devout meditation practitioners of ancient India. Mala, or Japa, beads were created so that a practitioner could focus on the meaning of a mantra while they were repeating it, rather than keeping track of how many times the mantra was repeated. By using the beads to focus solely on the meaning of the mantra and the experience of repeating the mantra, it allowed the practitioner to become fully absorbed in the practice. This type of single orientation is what mantra meditation is all about. Mala beads typically contain 108 beads plus a sumeru, or guru, bead (more about that later). If a pair of mala beads contains less than 108 beads, they usually include a number of beads that add up to a divisor of 108. The number 108 is an auspicious number in Eastern traditions and is believed to hold sacred meaning. There are many theories, ranging from mathematical theories to the study of Vedic anatomy, that explain why <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/the-number-108/">108</a> is so sacred. Mala bead meditation can also be helpful for meditators who wish to engage in secular, rather than a religious based, meditation. For example, certain sounds or words can be therapeutic when they are used in secular <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/sanskrit/mantras-101-the-science-behind-finding-your-mantra-and-how-to-practice-it/">mantra</a> meditation. By using mala beads, a meditator can repeat such calming sounds without having to keep track of how many times the sounds are repeated.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use Mala Beads </strong></p>
<p>Stemming from the Hindu tradition, a mala is typically held in the right hand, though some traditions call for the use of the left hand in mala meditation. As a practitioner, you would use the sumeru, or guru bead, as a reference point of where to begin. The guru bead is typically bigger than the other beads, so it’s easier to locate. Generally, you would move in a clockwise direction, so you would start your practice with the bead immediately to the right of the guru bead. In most traditions, the thumb and middle finger are used to move from bead to bead. It is believed that the pointer finger represents the ego, so that finger is usually avoided when moving down the mala. After grabbing the bead just to the right of the guru bead, you would use your thumb and middle finger to move from bead to bead down the mala until you reached the other end of the guru bead. This is considered a single round of chanting in traditional mala meditation. Once you have completed a round, you could either stop or keep going. If you chose to keep meditating, you would reverse your movement down the string of beads. With each round, the direction of counting or chanting is reversed.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Benefits of Using Mala Beads </strong></p>
<p>Meditation can be both arduous yet incredibly beneficial. Sometimes, it can be difficult for a person to choose a meditation style that suits their needs. There is a lot of misconception about what meditation is and how to properly do it. One universal characteristic of meditation that is found in nearly all practices is this idea of self-transcendence. Self-transcendence involves an orienting of one’s attention away from the ‘self’ and toward something more expansive and connected. Sometimes the ‘self’ is referred to as the ego. If you’ve ever experienced yourself feeling competitive in a yoga class, you know exactly how the ego can surface. You may have also noticed that a surfacing of the ego can disrupt your flow and take away from your meditative experience. In today’s modern world where we are always on the go, it’s so easy for the ego to take the driver’s seat and turn our attention inward. Even when we attempt to practice mindfulness, the tricky little ego can maneuver its way into the spotlight. Concentrated focus that is inward toward the self has the potential to lead to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KDoqDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">rumination</a> and depression. Meditating with mala beads allows a practitioner to easily focus on something external, which keeps self-oriented focus at bay. What’s more, the fact that mala beads encourage tactile engagement, there is a greater likelihood that the therapeutic benefits of meditation will permeate one’s psyche. In fact, research in the field of neuroscience has indicated that tactile engagement with an object is correlated with increased <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00368/full">attention</a>. What this means is that, when you are repeating a mantra while touching the mala beads, your brain has a better chance of internalizing the meaning of the mantra. As we’ve stated previously, a mantra doesn’t need to be based on a particular religion. A meditator should choose a mantra based on whatever phrase, sound, or word resonates with that person.</p>
<p><strong>Mala Beads and Yoga</strong></p>
<p>We are all super busy and it can be difficult to find time to slow down and allow for an integration of the mind, body, and spirit. It can be even more challenging to give your brain a good dose of daily meditation. Yoga allows you to do all of that in a single session. When you add mala beads to the mix, it’s a double win! If you have ever set an intention in a yoga class, you may have noticed that your intention resurfaced throughout the day after you left class. If you bring mala beads to your yoga classes, you can infuse each bead with your intention. Then, each time you reach for your beads, your brain will automatically recall the intention you set. Since wearing mala beads happens to be in vogue at the moment, you can wear your yoga infused beads close to your heart at all times, whether you are in the office or sweating it out in a vigorous yoga class. You can spice up your strand of mala beads (both literally and metaphorically) by including some gemstones. It is believed that various gemstones bear different energetic properties based on history and <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/meaning-history-gemstones-rubies-emeralds-diamonds">legends</a>. Say, for example, you are in serious need of some self-love, you may opt for a mala comprised of beautiful rose <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healing-with-rose-quartz#what-is-it">quartz</a> beads. Many people choose to make their own mala beads because it allows them to completely personalize their malas. The more personal your mala is, the more it will resonate with your soul. The process of making a mala can also be therapeutic in and of itself and it gives you time to infuse your mala with your own individualized wishes and prayers. Each time you grab your mala, you’ll remember how you wanted to feel and who you wanted to be when you made it. The coolness of the beads against your skin may have a cleansing effect that reaches all the way into your soul. With your own mala beads, you can take your elevated yoga practice with you off the mat and keep it with you, close to your heart, always.</p>`

    title: "Yoga for Athletes",
    metadata: `<p><strong>How Stress Impacts the Body </strong></p>
<p>Before understanding how yoga can be beneficial to athletes and non-athletes alike, let us briefly introduce how the human body has evolved to respond to stress. According to Hans Selye, there are different stages of stress and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/6/2/117/2722959">adaptation</a>; the way in which you respond to stress at each stage has a huge impact on your body. The first stage is the alarm stage, where a specific event causes your body to fight, flight, or freeze. This event can be a major life event, such as losing a loved one, or it can be a specific event in a particular activity, such as your tennis opponent serving up a move that you didn’t anticipate. In an attempt to return to homeostasis, the body can respond in one of two ways after the alarm stage: the body can either resist or adapt. In the resistance stage, your body allocates more resources toward preparing your body to resist any potential harm. This causes your body to freeze and diminishes your cognitive capacity, leaving you with little ability to effectively problem solve. Resistance tends to occur when we don’t take a moment to breathe and regain control of our bodies and minds. In the adaptation stage, on the other hand, your body and mind remain calm, requiring less resource re-allocation. This, essentially, frees up your mind so you are better able to adapt to the novel situation. If you resist, you are more likely to move into what is known as the ‘exhaustion stage’. If unimpeded, the exhaustion stage can lead to a condition known as ‘chronic fatigue’, which can wreak havoc on the body and cause long term health issues. Chronic fatigue is linked to chronic inflammation of the body, which has been known to contribute to numerous diseases. Yoga has been shown to improve how we respond to stress, both in life and in situations requiring us to “stay on our game”. With its incorporation of pranayama, or yoga breathing, the mindfulness component of yoga, and the physical resilience that it fosters, yoga is the perfect way to make us more resilient and adaptable, even in the face of high stress or physically demanding tasks.</p>

<p>Yoga has been shown to improve range of motion, flexibility, and <a href="http://www.journalshr.com/index.php/issues/2009/36-vol-1-n2-september-december-2009">mobility</a>, all of which are vital in maintaining superior performance. Before we dive in, let’s define these three concepts. First, range of motion is the distance your joints can move freely in any direction without resulting in pain. Flexibility refers to the ability to bend with ease without breaking. Finally, mobility is the ability to move without restriction. Regardless of your fitness goals, all three of these are essential in maintaining optimal physical health. If you are an athlete, maintaining all three of these things is exceptionally important. Take this example: say you are a marathon runner, and you have limited range of motion, flexibility, and mobility. These limitations may cause you to over-rely on muscles that are intended to merely support your primary running muscles. This may, in turn, inhibit the use of the primary muscles that are intended to be the predominant muscles utilized in running. Over time, this type of compensation creates an imbalance in your body and can lead to injury, both in the short term and in the long term. Failing to address such imbalances can cause your body to grow accustomed to moving inappropriately, which can lead to sustained damage and injury. With its arsenal of yoga postures and emphasis on proper alignment, yoga provides you with a chance to increase your range of motion, flexibility, and mobility in a manner that is safe and beneficial for your body. Speaking of proper alignment, let us move to the next physical benefit of adding yoga to your current fitness regimen.</p>
<p><u>Enhanced Bodily Awareness</u></p>
<p>Because athletes and experts alike tend to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1037/gpr0000054">automatize</a> their movements in their respective activities, present moment bodily awareness may be less prevalent in these groups. This means that, if a person is not engaging in their activity mindfully and an injury occurs, they may not notice discomfort in the heat of the moment. This may cause the person to continue performing in a manner that will contribute to sustained injury. If you’ve ever known someone who has torn their meniscus while running or playing basketball, they may have told you that they weren’t even aware that their meniscus had been torn. They may also have told you that their meniscus took a long time to heal. This is because the meniscus doesn’t have direct blood supply or nerve interaction, making it more difficult to notice in the heat of an activity. This is also why it takes so long for the meniscus to heal. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301593822_An_Introduction_to_Proprioception_Concept_in_Pilates_and_Yoga">Yoga</a> increases body awareness and proprioception, which helps a person become more attuned to what is going in their bodies and in the environment in each moment. In the practice of yoga, we learn to become more aware of differing sensations in parts of our bodies. For example, when doing a forward fold in yoga, you may notice that your right hamstring is much tighter than your left hamstring. This type of awareness is vital in all fitness domains because it allows you to tend to any maladaptive overreliance in your body <em>before</em> chronic injury occurs. Such knowledge can give you a chance to increase muscle <a href="https://ericcressey.com/yoga-for-athletes-activation-inhibition-stretching">activation</a> and functional movement on a part of your body that is imbalanced. This is the type of balance that you need to perform your very best in the long run.</p>
<p><u>Accelerated Muscle Recovery</u></p>
<p>Yoga has also been shown to enhance and speed up muscle recovery. It does so by increasing blood flow to the muscles that have just been activated in your previous activity. While stress on the body, such as the stress we experience in vigorous physical exercise, is beneficial for the body, it also results in a depletion of energy in both the muscles and the mind immediately following the stressful activity. This is why rest and recovery are essential in every domain. Muscle gains resulting from a vigorous workout occur during the rest and recovery phase of your workout. Your body must go through this process before it can return to its optimal state, which takes anywhere from 2-7 days. If you’re an athlete, you likely want to get back to your strongest self as quickly as possible. Fatigued muscles will inevitably hinder your performance so, as an athlete, speeding up the healing process is something that may be of great interest to you. While every athlete likely understands the importance of rest and recovery, there may be less known about the finding that <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DnE6CgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=yoga+for+speeding+up+recovery&amp;ots=cL1mQPAX-1&amp;sig=5x9JFx4IGjSVuaww6pboPVFyRmU#v=onepage&amp;q=yoga%20for%20speeding%20up%20recovery&amp;f=false">yoga</a> can actually speed up recovery and is better than rest alone. Even if you aren’t an athlete, recovery is beneficial for anyone who wants to feel better (isn’t that all of us?).</p>
<p><u>Proper Core Engagement </u></p>
<p>Learning how to engage your core properly is essential in preventing injury. You may spend years in the gym working on your ‘abs’ but never really learn to engage your core properly. In yoga, we learn to activate our various bandhas, which are areas in the body that we learn to engage to maintain stability in practicing asanas.  One of the bandhas that is commonly used is called the Uddiyana Bandha. The Uddiyana Bandha, which is known as ‘the core lock’, teaches you to properly engage your core so that your spine is protected. If you’ve ever heard the phrases “sink your navel toward your spine” or “knit your ribs in” in a yoga class, you have experienced instruction on engaging your Uddiyana Bandha. This type of core engagement is useful in all aspects of life, both on and off the mat and in and out of the gym. For example, if you are a new mother who recently gave birth and are experiencing a weakness in your core, engagement of the Uddiyana Bandha can help you learn to engage your core properly so you can regain strength in the core muscles that were weakened during pregnancy. Engaging your core properly can also prevent you from experiencing injury in your lower back from lifting a heavy object. The core muscles include more than just your exterior ab muscles (such as the ones that make up the beautiful six-packs we often see in fitness magazines), they also include deep muscles, such as the transverse abdominis, that, while not as aesthetic, help to support your spine. If you’ve experienced diastasis recti after having a baby (which causes your stomach muscles to separate), proper engagement of the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jwhpt/Abstract/2012/09000/Diastasis_Recti_Abdominis__A_Survey_of_Women_s.4.aspx">transverse</a> abdominis can help your bring your stomach muscles back together (did someone say, bikini season?). By learning to engage your Uddiyana Bandha properly, you can both protect your spine and build a stronger core. In addition to engagement of the Uddiyana Bandha, the utilization of diaphragmatic breathing in yoga can also help you to engage your core properly. Because diaphragmatic breathing results in increased intra-abdominal pressure, this type of breathing is essential in protecting your core, especially when lifting <a href="https://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/2004/02150/The_Effects_of_Breath_Control_on_Intra_Abdominal.21.aspx">heavy</a> objects.</p>
<p><u>Regulate Nervous System</u></p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, the parasympathetic nervous system is essential for returning your body back to its baseline. While there are several methods you can employ for accessing your parasympathetic nervous system, yoga is an excellent way to get your parasympathetic nervous system back online. There are three components of yoga that make it one of the best ways to regulate your nervous system. The first is the movement aspect. Moving your body all at once is one of the most effective ways to regulate your nervous system when you are in a state of fight or flight. The second component is the mindfulness aspect, which teaches you to notice moment to moment fluctuations of the mind through a lens of nonjudgment. Because your mind and body work together as a system, when your mind is in a state of panic, your body releases all sorts of chemicals to prepare you to fight or flight. While this neuro-physical reaction contributed to the survival of our ancestors, it can get in the way of performing our very best in these modern times. In the short term, an aggravated nervous system can cause your body to shut down, leaving you with little cognitive resources to allocate toward making sound decisions. In the long term, having an unregulated nervous system can lead to disease, as we mentioned previously. The mindfulness component of yoga teaches you to use your higher cognitive processes to regulate your nervous system. With practice, this type of mental training can enhance your mental clarity, so you are better able to respond to high stake situations, both physically and mentally. The third component of yoga that makes it the best for regulating the nervous system is the breathing aspect of yoga, or pranayama. The Vagus Nerve, which helps to regulate the nervous system and has been linked to healthy biological <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40473-014-0010-5">functioning</a>, is stimulated when you exhale. There are many ways to regulate breathing that aren’t related to yoga or pranayama and, thus, you don’t necessarily need to do yoga to stimulate the Vagus Nerve. However, if you’ve ever practiced pranayama in yoga, you probably know how different it is from regular controlled breathing. The way in which movement is linked to breath in the practice of yoga makes effective breathing techniques more accessible and less anxiety inducing. With movement, mindfulness, and breathing as the core tenants of yoga, we think yoga is one of the best ways to regulate your nervous system. As we’ve mentioned throughout the article, regulating your nervous system is vital for both your physical and mental health. This seems like a good place to transition into the mental benefits of yoga that will help you to be your best self!</p>
<p><strong>Mental Benefits of Adding Yoga </strong></p>
<p><u>Myelination</u></p>
<p>If you are an athlete or do any other type of activity that requires a certain level of ‘performance’ on your part (yes, this includes giving a presentation at work), you could benefit greatly from the mental benefits of yoga that can help to keep you sharp and on your game. If you’ve ever been stumped by an opponent in your sport (or by an obnoxious co-worker who is always trying to one-up you), how you react makes all the difference in the world in determining whether you will be triumphant. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5859868/">Myelination</a> is a process that occurs neurochemically in the circuitry systems of the human brain and plays a major role in decision-making. An oversimplified explanation of myelination is this: the more you practice something and prime yourself for all possible outcomes in a given situation, the more prepared you will be in making effective decisions in real time; this is all thanks to the process of myelination. The human brain is highly efficient; myelination is part of the brain’s efficiency process. Myelination occurs in the brain to help make problem solving more efficient and readily available. It is typically highly specialized, meaning that your brain is hard wired to respond optimally in your particular area of expertise. Myelination, which is linked to enhanced <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4261922/">learning</a>, requires a calm, alert, and receptive mind. Yoga helps to cultivate a calm and present mind that is open to receiving information, which is necessary for myelination to occur. There are some diseases that are related to reduced myelination, such as multiple sclerosis. Research has shown that yoga has been an effective adjunct treatment in managing multiple sclerosis, indicating that yoga may have some impact on the process of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0975947618309239">myelination</a>. Athletes and experts alike should strive to increase their myelination because it helps to make them a more efficient and effective performer in their respective fields, even when the stakes are high.</p>
<p><u>Reduce Performance Anxiety and Improve Self Esteem </u></p>
<p>Yoga has also been shown to reduce performance anxiety, which is especially important for athletes. Performance anxiety has been shown to thwart athletic <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Mindfulness_in_Positive_Psychology.html?id=KabDCwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description">performance</a>. This is because focusing on negative emotions and thoughts requires a lot of cognitive resources and, thus, takes away from one’s ability to devote such resources to performing well. In addition to depleting cognitive resources, your body will respond to anxiety by allocating <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score.html?id=T7iJDQAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description">biological</a> resources to the parts of your body that will assist you in engaging in either “fight” or “flight”. This adaptive role of the human body, which was once helpful in increasing the likelihood of individual survival, requires energy and, thus, takes away from your ability to perform optimally. If you’ve ever heard of the term “choking” in sport, you are aware of such phenomenon. The mindfulness aspect of yoga can help reduce performance anxiety because it teaches a person to simply notice negative emotions without assigning judgment to such emotions. This, essentially, allows such thoughts to flow in and out of consciousness with less impact on one’s ability to perform.  Research has also shown that yoga is linked to improved <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7567196/">self-esteem</a>. Self-esteem is directly linked to performance because self-esteem can trigger or exacerbate performance anxiety. This can create a vicious cycle that can negatively affect someone’s performance in both the short term and in the long run. Yoga helps you to cultivate a sense of self-compassion, acceptance, present moment awareness, and may also help you to adopt a non-judgmental approach in recognizing your transient thoughts. All of this will help to improve your performance, both on and off the field.</p>
<p><u>Mindfulness and Flow</u></p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Flow_the_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experienc.html?id=tSD3tgEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description">Flow</a> has been described as the “the experience of total involvement in what one is doing. The experience of flow is vital in performing your very best. In a state of flow, you are literally “giving it your all”. The Mindful Acceptance Commitment (MAC) is one of the most heavily <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Mindfulness_in_Positive_Psychology.html?id=KabDCwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description">researched</a> mindfulness interventions in sport and is growing in its popularity. It has been shown that effective mindfulness practices can help someone achieve a state of flow. This is especially important when your goal is to maintain a state of flow in a high-pressure environment. When the pressure is high, your likelihood of being distracted by negative, anxious, or over analytical thoughts increases. When you are performing in a high-pressure environment, being distracted by such thoughts can have greater consequences than when you are performing in a low-pressure environment. By practicing mindfulness on a regular basis, your brain will be more primed to engage in mindfulness when the stakes are high, which will help you achieve flow in such states. As we have discussed, mindfulness is a core component of yoga. A regular yoga practice can help you to cultivate a capacity to engage in mindfulness, even when under intense pressure. Whether you are an athlete, have a stressful job, or maintain a chaotic household (uh, most of us), achieving flow will help you!</p>
<p><strong>How you Structure your Yoga Sessions Matters </strong></p>
<p>Now that we have discussed all the benefits of yoga, it’s important to touch upon the necessity of determining how you structure your yoga sessions. If life is your sport and yoga is your primary physical activity, you may have more flexibility (pun intended) in how you structure your yoga sessions. However, if your physical activities go beyond yoga and, depending on your fitness goals, the way in which you structure your yoga sessions needs to be considered. If flexibility is important for your sport or activity, yoga before working out may be beneficial. However, your yoga session in such a case should be shorter in duration. On the other hand, if your activity requires strength or endurance, you are better off scheduling your yoga class for after your workout or for another day. The type of yoga you add to your fitness regimen also plays a role when deciding how to structure your yoga around your workouts. Some styles of yoga are slower and consist of stretching of a more static nature, where poses are held for longer periods of time. Yin yoga, restorative yoga, and slow flow yoga are just a few styles of yoga that may fall under this category. However, some styles of yoga are comprised of more dynamic movement where the movement is more fast paced and where the poses are held for less time than in static stretching styles of yoga. Vinyasa and power yoga sometimes fall under this category. As an athlete, or even sole yoga practitioner, it&#8217;s important to understand the difference between static stretching and dynamic movement. Static stretching typically involves moving a part of your body to the limits of its range of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-011-1879-2">motion</a>. Such movement is acute and typically results in increased flexibility in the musculotendinous component of the body part in which you are stretching. This type of movement is important for increasing flexibility and range of motion in the long run. However, in the short term, it can lead to a temporary decease in strength (don’t worry, the strength will come back) and could hinder performance in the short term. Dynamic movement, on the other hand, consists of larger amplitude movements that are held for shorter periods of time. The purpose of dynamic warm-ups is to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-011-1879-2">increase</a> your body’s internal temperature, which helps prepare your muscles to engage at their highest capacity. Here is an example of a practical application of the concepts we just discussed: say you run a marathon over the weekend. Your body will benefit greatly from adding a restorative or slow flow class to, say, the Monday after your weekend marathon. Doing a restorative or slow flow class before your marathon on the same day may actually hinder your performance. However, doing some sun salutations prior to your race may be beneficial in warming up your muscles.</p>
<p><strong><u>Bottom Line: Yoga Improves Performance</u></strong></p>
<p>Now that we’ve inundated your brain with all sorts of information, lets get to the point: yoga will improve your performance, regardless of your sport or activity. If you want to stay mentally sharp, yoga can help. If you want to protect your muscles from injury, yoga can help. If you want to learn to regulate your nervous system, yoga can help. So, while your schedule may be demanding, finding time to include yoga will only benefit you, both in the short term and in the long run. Remember, you don’t have to fit a certain narrative to start practicing yoga; yoga is for everyone!</p>`

    title: "A Breakdown of our Class Styles",
    metadata: `<p><strong>Yoga: A Brief History</strong></p>
<p>The practice of yoga is certainly not lacking in variety. Though we all love having plenty of options, having too many choices can be overwhelming. While most practices of yoga have considerable similarities, there are some differences that may influence your decision about which is best for you. To understand the different styles of yoga, let’s take a super quick dive into the history of yoga. While the specific details of the history of yoga are still up for debate, the relics left behind by the ancient sages of yoga tell us that yoga may have emerged long before any systemized religious or belief systems <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Pick_Your_Yoga_Practice.html?id=dRvdAQAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description">existed</a>. This means that yoga can be practiced by anyone, regardless of religion. It is believed that, since its inception, yoga has consisted of various poses (asanas), differing breathing techniques (pranayama), and varying meditation techniques. When it was originally practiced, the main tenets of yoga were more about the mind-body-spirit connection and accessing heightened states of awareness and less about the gymnastics associated with modern yoga. The practice of asanas, or postures, were included for the sole purpose of making meditation more accessible. It was believed that practicing asanas prior to meditation would prime the body to sit comfortably in a prolonged seated meditation session. The physical aspect of yoga, originally known as ‘Hatha yoga’, was only a small part of the practice. Now let’s get to the more modern history of yoga. Tirumalai Krishnamacharya was a yogi from India in the late 1800’s; he is widely known as the ‘father of modern yoga’. <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Pick_Your_Yoga_Practice.html?id=dRvdAQAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description">Three</a> of his students shaped the way we practice yoga today: B. K. S. Iyengar popularized Hatha yoga by emphasizing precision and alignment, thus making it more accessible to a wider variety of bodies. K. Pattabhi Jois founded Ashtanga-Vinyasa yoga, which was a more vigorous practice and that which emphasized the art of linking breath to movement. Finally, Krishnamacharya’s son, T. K. V. Desikachar influenced the development of Viniyoga. Viniyoga focused more on the ‘therapeutic’ aspect of yoga, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>The type of yoga that is practiced most widely today is (more or less) a combination of the Hatha, Ashtanga-Vinyasa, and Viniyoga practices that were birthed by the students of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. While most modern classes embody all three of these styles, different classes may adhere to one style more than another. An overly simplified, but perhaps useful, way to categorize the differences is this: Slow Flow classes may more closely resemble Hatha style yoga, with an emphasis on alignment; Flow classes may feel more vigorous and cardio intensive, like Ashtanga; Restorative yoga may be categorized as more therapeutic and, thus, more closely resembles Viniyoga. While all this information is interesting, you may still feel bewildered about which type of yoga will suit your needs best. Let’s look at how different types of stretching may impact your overall goals first.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic vs. Static Stretching in Yoga </strong></p>
<p>An understanding of the difference between static and dynamic stretching can be helpful prior to choosing a yoga class to incorporate into your schedule. Dynamic stretching involves large amplitude movements that are held for a shorter duration when compared to static stretching. Dynamic movements also tend to be more fast paced and, therefore, get your heart pumping a little more than static stretching may. Styles of yoga that may fit into this category include Flow, Vinyasa, and Power Yoga. If you’ve ever been to one of these types of classes, you may have noticed that your heart was pumping faster than usual in the midst of your yoga sesh. Static stretching, on the other hand, involves more acute movement where an individual limb is typically moved to its end range of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-011-1879-2">motion</a>. Static stretching tends to consist of poses that are held for a longer duration. This type of stretching is helpful in increasing flexibility. Types of yoga that may fall under this category include Slow Flow, Yin, and other classes comprised of longer holds. Each type of stretching can be beneficial for the body and should be incorporated at different times. For example, if you are running a marathon and you want to integrate some yoga warmups prior to your activity, you are better off doing yoga that involves more dynamic movement. It has been shown that static stretching prior to certain athletic activities may inhibit your performance and may reduce muscle strength. However, research has also shown that including static stretching is important in the long run to help reduce injury and maintain muscle health integrity. If you are an athlete, scheduling yoga classes that are more ‘static’ in nature in between your intense workouts and performances can help you speed up your recovery time. Like with anything else, the difference between dynamic and static styles of yoga exists on a spectrum and can vary greatly from class to class. It’s always important to know your body and to understand your limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Foundations </strong></p>
<p>A Foundations class is an excellent yoga class for beginners because it focuses on the fundamental yoga poses, which are the building blocks of the more advanced poses. The poses you will learn in a Foundations class are arguably the most important poses you will learn in yoga. Regardless of your overall fitness level, if you are new to yoga or have limited yoga experience, this class will be beneficial to you. Even if you are an experienced yogi who has practiced for decades, a Foundations class can help you to refine your practice. Many yogis find that, to accomplish more advanced poses, they need to go back and refine the most basic of poses. For example, if you’re an experienced yogi and you’ve been struggling to nail that ‘ever- elusive’ forearm stand, refining your Dolphin pose may be your solution. The more advanced poses often require the use of deep core muscles that you may have overlooked when you first learned the foundational poses. A Foundations class is also helpful in introducing breathwork, which can be challenging for those who have never practiced it. Pranayama, or the breathwork component of yoga, is key to the practice. Like most things, breathwork can range from entry-level to more advanced. If you are new to breathwork or meditation, learning the basics is essential in becoming more adept in the practice of Pranayama. A Foundations class will help you build a solid foundation upon which you can advance your meditative practice.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Flow </strong></p>
<p>As we discussed previously, Slow Flow classes can sometimes fall under the more ‘static’ categories of yoga. The types of poses that are practiced in Slow Flow classes have been linked to reduced likelihood of injury and accelerated muscle <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DnE6CgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=yoga+for+speeding+up+recovery&amp;ots=cL1mQPAX-1&amp;sig=5x9JFx4IGjSVuaww6pboPVFyRmU#v=onepage&amp;q=yoga%20for%20speeding%20up%20recovery&amp;f=false">recovery</a> in athletes. Unlike in Flow (as we will discuss below), Slow Flow classes give you a chance to sit in poses for longer periods of time. This increased time allows you to enhance your mind/body connection because you have more time to reflect on what you are experiencing in your body on a moment-to-moment basis. This type of information can be helpful in identifying areas in your body that may require more attention, such as an imbalance or overreliance on a particular part of your body. The enhanced mind/body connection that a Slow Flow class will instill in your mind and body can also automatize effective movement and breathing strategies that can optimize your well-being. For example, <a href="https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score">yoga</a> has been shown to improve heart rate variability (HRV), which is a biomarker of enhanced affective and physical well-being that is related to an increased mind-body connection. Speaking of affective well-being, the type of slow and controlled movement that a Slow Flow class offers can do wonders for your mind! The type of introspection that is fostered in Slow Flow classes can be exceptionally helpful in building a capacity for mindfulness, which can transcend beyond the yoga mat. We live in a society that is extremely fast paced, where everything is “go, go, go”, and where time for introspection is limited. A Slow Flow class can be the ideal place to practice the meditative skills you’ve been wanting to cultivate. Meditative skills, such as the ones that are sowed in Slow Flow classes, can improve your overall productivity. Like a Foundations class, a Slow Flow class can be great for both new and experienced yogis alike!</p>
<p><strong>Flow</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to Slow Flow, Flow classes tend to be more fast paced and cardio intensive. Such classes typically include several sun salutations, and the movements are often more dynamic in nature. The type of dynamic stretching that is taught in Flow classes can be exceptionally beneficial for warming up the body prior to certain athletic pursuits. Yoga experience is often recommended prior to attending a Flow class. Flow classes, especially the more advanced level ones, will likely include challenging poses that require balance and strength. This type of muscle engagement can lead to improved body composition and an increased ability to use deep core muscles that may be overlooked when performing traditional strengthening gym exercises. Also, because Flow classes have a propensity to get your heart rate pumping, a Flow class can be a great alternative to aerobic exercise. One study found that high speed yoga, such as the type of yoga practiced in a Flow class, can be an effective form of exercise to target <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229916302278">cardiometabolic</a> factors. This is important because, The Centers for Disease Control (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm">CDC</a>) recommends that healthy adults engage in a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week to maintain optimal health. Finding an extra 150 minutes each week can be difficult if your schedule is jam packed (and your commute to work consists of a long drive, rather than a walk). Two Flow classes a week and a short walk will help you to achieve that CDC recommendation. If you’re looking for a challenging, invigorating, sweat inducing, heart pumping, and super productive yoga session, look no further than a Flow class!</p>
<p><strong>Restorative </strong></p>
<p>Restorative yoga may be described as one of the most passive and meditative forms of yoga. Restorative yoga is super inclusive and is notorious for promoting peace and tranquility in the mind and body. The poses in Restorative classes typically involve the practitioner either lying down on their backs or seated with the support of props. This allows the practitioner to fully rest into their own bodies and cultivate a sense of acceptance. Restorative yoga can be very therapeutic, both mentally and physically. Every single human body can benefit from a Restorative class. Such classes may be exceptionally helpful for athletes in aiding in recovery. Many advanced yoga practitioners like to include Restorative classes to their schedule because it can serve as a great complement to the more vigorous physical yoga practices. Restorative classes can promote stillness that may, otherwise, be difficult to come by. <a href="https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Anxiety-Disorders">Anxiety</a> is the most common mental health concern in the US, impacting over 19% of the population. The parasympathetic nervous system, when activated, can serve as a ‘brake’ for anxiety. Because Restorative yoga is so passive, it fosters a heightened state of relaxation. This, in turn, can activate your parasympathetic nervous system. Because of its relaxing and healing nature, Restorative yoga can be an excellent technique for alleviating anxiety symptoms. With a regular practice of Restorative yoga, your ability to activate your parasympathetic nervous system, all by yourself and on demand, will grow. Think of a time when you could have used an enhanced braking system for your anxious tendencies. All of us modern folks could benefit from enhancing our parasympathetic nervous system responsivity! Restorative yoga is also great for you physically. We discussed the difference between static and dynamic stretching previously. Restorative yoga doesn’t necessarily fall into either of these categories. Instead of targeting your exterior muscles actively, Restorative yoga impacts the interior connective tissues of your body in a manner that is gentler. This type of activation, while often overlooked in traditional exercise, is vital in maintaining overall health. This is especially true for athletes and people who are active. Restorative yoga helps to aid in recovery by decreasing muscle tension, increasing circulation, increasing blood flow to internal organs, and improving immune system <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Triathlon/News/Blogs/Multisport-Lab/2018/May/18/Recharge-Your-Body-with-Restorative-Yoga">functioning</a>. As humans with nervous systems, we should all give Restorative yoga a try!</p>
<p><strong>Why Choose Just One? </strong></p>

    title: "How a Gratitude Journal Changed my Life",
    metadata: `<p>About ten years ago, I participated in a 40-day yoga immersion and one of the exercises we were assigned on day 1 was to write down 8 things we were grateful for each day. I had never been much of a journal person. I think part of the reason was because I had been living with anxiety since my late teens and the idea of putting my thoughts down on paper scared me. In my head, they could remain abstract and I could keep them to myself.  Writing them down would give them a place to materialize outside of my head, and this wasn’t something I wanted to entertain.  However, transformation was the name of the game when I joined this 40-day immersion, and I made a commitment to myself to go all in.  I wasn’t going to start picking and choosing what to do just because it was out of my comfort zone.  I had let fear guide my actions for the better part of two decades and this was an opportunity to do things differently. Besides, it was just writing down what I’m grateful for so the risk seemed pretty low.</p>
<p class="p1">The first week went pretty smoothly. It was as if I had a stockpile of people, places and things that would step up on command – my mom, my dad, my dog, my kids, my husband, etc – the easy stuff.  After that first week, it got a little more challenging as I was determined not to repeat what I had already been grateful for.  I’m not sure why I did this.  It wasn’t part of the exercise.  The rules and restrictions we put on ourselves are very interesting when we allow ourselves to notice them.</p>
<p class="p1">About two weeks in, I began to notice a shift. Throughout the day, I found myself looking around and thinking about what I was grateful for so my time with that journal would be easier. Thoughts of gratitude began to replace the anxiety-laden ‘what if’ thoughts. I observed nature more, found myself being grateful for the sunshine, the beautiful flowers as they were blooming, Mother Earth. When people in other cars would wave me through, I would feel a true sense of gratitude for them, rather than just going through the motions of waving back and continuing my drive. My life became more relaxed, my heart more open.</p>
<p class="p1">I have since led several 200-hour yoga teacher trainings and I always have students begin a gratitude journal on day 1 in the hope that I can pay it forward and share the gift that was given to me by this simple exercise. They often share similar experiences.</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t remember much else from the 40-day yoga immersion other than the intense 5:00am asana practices, but I’ll never forget that it is where my gratitude journey truly began.</p>
<p><em>Heather is an E-RYT 500 Hour, YACEP certified yoga instructor. </em><em>Her mission as a yoga teacher is to provide a space and a practice that invites students of all levels on a journey of self-exploration and self-discovery that they can take off the mat to lead a consciously-aware, loving and fulfilled life.

    title: "Beyond Asana: The Eight Limbs of Yoga",
    metadata: `<ol>
<li>Yamas &#8211; The first limb of yoga, the Yamas, refers to the ethical guidelines for how to interact with the world around us. These guidelines include non-violence (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya), non-stealing (asteya), moderation (brahmacharya), and non-possessiveness (aparigraha).</li>
<li>Niyamas &#8211; The second limb of yoga, the Niyamas, refers to the ethical guidelines for how to interact with ourselves. These guidelines include cleanliness (saucha), contentment (santosha), discipline (tapas), self-study (svadhyaya), and surrender to a higher power (ishvara pranidhana).</li>
<li>Asana &#8211; The third limb of yoga, Asana, refers to the physical practice of yoga postures. Asanas are designed to improve flexibility, strength, balance, and coordination, and to prepare the body for meditation and spiritual practices.</li>
<li>Pranayama &#8211; The fourth limb of yoga, Pranayama, refers to the practice of controlling the breath. Pranayama exercises are designed to improve the flow of prana (life force energy) in the body, and to calm the mind and nervous system.</li>
<li>Pratyahara &#8211; The fifth limb of yoga, Pratyahara, refers to the withdrawal of the senses from external stimuli. This practice is intended to help quiet the mind and focus inward, preparing the practitioner for deeper states of meditation.</li>
<li>Dharana &#8211; The sixth limb of yoga, Dharana, refers to concentration. This practice involves focusing the mind on a single object, such as the breath, a mantra, or an image, and learning to maintain that focus over time.</li>
<li>Dhyana &#8211; The seventh limb of yoga, Dhyana, refers to meditation. This practice involves maintaining a state of awareness without a specific focus, allowing the mind to become more open and receptive.</li>
<li>Samadhi &#8211; The eighth and final limb of yoga, Samadhi, refers to a state of oneness with the universe. This is the ultimate goal of yoga, and is achieved through a complete merging of the individual consciousness with the universal consciousness.</li>
</ol>
<p>This comprehensive framework of ethical principles, physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation practices provide a more complete picture of the practice of yoga. Join us for one of our Complete Practice workshops as we dive more deeply into this practice and spend a little more time incorporating the other limbs during our time together.</p>`

    title: "The Power of Breath: How Pranayama Can Transform Your Practice",
    metadata: `<p>In the fast-paced world we live in, finding moments of tranquility and self-awareness has become more critical than ever. Yoga has gained popularity worldwide for its ability to promote physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. At the heart of this ancient art lies pranayama, the practice of controlled breathing. Pranayama, often referred to as the &#8220;science of breath,&#8221; is an integral part of yoga and has the power to transform your yoga practice in profound ways. In this blog post, we will explore the incredible benefits of pranayama and how incorporating it into your yoga routine can lead to a transformative journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Understanding Pranayama</p>
<p>Pranayama, derived from the Sanskrit words &#8220;prana&#8221; (life force) and &#8220;ayama&#8221; (expansion), is a series of breathing techniques aimed at harnessing and channeling the life force energy within us. The practice involves conscious manipulation of the breath, both in terms of depth and duration, to achieve specific outcomes. The breath is considered the bridge between the body and the mind, and by mastering it, practitioners can enhance their physical and mental states.</p>
<p>Benefits of Pranayama</p>
<ol>
<li>Stress Reduction and Relaxation: One of the most immediate and noticeable effects of pranayama is its ability to calm the mind and reduce stress. Slow, rhythmic breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, triggering the relaxation response and promoting a sense of tranquility.</li>
<li>Improved Focus and Concentration: Pranayama techniques demand mental attentiveness, training the mind to stay present and focused. Regular practice can significantly enhance concentration and mindfulness in daily life.</li>
<li>Increased Vitality: Pranayama nourishes the body with a higher level of oxygen, increasing vitality and boosting overall energy levels. This revitalization is essential for coping with the demands of modern life.</li>
<li>Enhanced Physical Performance: Controlled breathing during yoga poses optimizes oxygen utilization in muscles, allowing practitioners to delve deeper into their practice, enhance flexibility, and build strength.</li>
<li>Emotional Balance: The breath has a profound impact on our emotional state. By regulating the breath, pranayama helps stabilize emotions and foster a more balanced outlook on life.</li>
<li>Detoxification: Deep breathing aids in efficient lymphatic drainage, helping the body eliminate toxins and waste products more effectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>Incorporating Pranayama into Your Practice</p>
<p>Adding pranayama to your yoga routine doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. Here are some simple yet potent techniques to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ujjayi Breath: Also known as the &#8220;ocean breath,&#8221; Ujjayi involves breathing in and out through the nose while slightly constricting the back of the throat. The resulting sound is akin to the waves of the ocean, which helps create a meditative focus and soothes the mind.</li>
<li>Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril Breathing): This technique involves breathing through one nostril while closing the other, alternating between the left and right nostrils. Nadi Shodhana helps balance the flow of energy in the body and clears the nadis (energy channels).</li>
<li>Bhramari (Bee Breath): Bhramari involves inhaling deeply and exhaling while making a humming sound, resembling the buzzing of a bee. This technique calms the mind and alleviates stress and anxiety.</li>
<li>Kapalabhati (Skull-Shining Breath): Kapalabhati involves forceful exhalations followed by passive inhalations. It is excellent for clearing the respiratory system, increasing lung capacity, and invigorating the body.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pranayama is a powerful tool that holds the potential to transform your yoga practice and, consequently, your entire life. By mastering the art of controlled breathing, you can experience profound physical, mental, and emotional changes. Whether you are a seasoned yogi or just beginning your journey, incorporating pranayama into your practice will undoubtedly open new doors to self-awareness, inner peace, and holistic well-being. Embrace the power of breath, and let pranayama be your guide on the path of self-transformation.</p>

    title: "Integrating Yoga into Daily Life: Practical Tips for Incorporating Yoga Off the Mat",
    metadata: `
    <p>Yoga is often associated with the physical practice of asanas (poses) on the mat, but its true essence extends far beyond. Integrating yoga into your daily life involves embracing its principles, such as mindfulness, breath control, and ethical guidelines, in every aspect of your routine. Here are practical tips to help you incorporate yoga off the mat and enrich your everyday experiences.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">1. Start Your Day with Intention</span></h5>
<p><strong>Morning Rituals</strong>: Begin your day with a short meditation or mindfulness practice. Set a positive intention or a Sankalpa for the day. This could be something like &#8220;I will approach today with compassion and patience&#8221; or &#8220;I will be present in each moment.&#8221; This practice helps ground you and sets a mindful tone for the rest of the day.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">2. Practice Mindful Breathing</span></h5>
<p><strong>Breath Awareness</strong>: Throughout your day, take moments to focus on your breath. Whether you&#8217;re sitting at your desk, standing in line, or stuck in traffic, practice deep, conscious breathing. Try techniques like diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing) or Nadi Shodhana (alternate nostril breathing) to calm your mind and reduce stress.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">3. Move Mindfully</span></h5>
<p><strong>Mindful Movement</strong>: Incorporate mindful movement into your daily activities. Pay attention to your posture while sitting, standing, and walking. Engage your core, relax your shoulders, and move with awareness. If you have a sedentary job, take breaks to stretch and do simple yoga poses like Tadasana (Mountain Pose) or Uttanasana (Forward Fold).</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">4. Practice Mindfulness in Daily Activities</span></h5>
<p><strong>Mindful Eating</strong>: Turn meals into a mindfulness practice. Eat slowly, savor each bite, and pay attention to the flavors, textures, and sensations. This not only enhances your enjoyment of food but also improves digestion and fosters a healthier relationship with eating.</p>
<p><strong>Mindful Tasks</strong>: Engage fully in whatever you are doing, whether it&#8217;s washing dishes, driving, or having a conversation. Avoid multitasking and give your full attention to the present moment. This helps cultivate a sense of peace and satisfaction in everyday tasks.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">5. Apply Yoga Philosophy</span></h5>
<p><strong>Yamas and Niyamas</strong>: Integrate the ethical principles of yoga, the Yamas (restraints) and Niyamas (observances), into your life. Practice Ahimsa (non-violence) by being kind to yourself and others. Embrace Satya (truthfulness) in your thoughts, words, and actions. Practice Saucha (cleanliness) by keeping your environment and mind clear and organized.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">6. Cultivate Gratitude</span></h5>
<p><strong>Gratitude Practice</strong>: Take a few moments each day to reflect on what you are grateful for. This can be done through journaling, mental notes, or sharing your gratitude with others. A regular gratitude practice can shift your perspective and enhance your overall well-being.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">7. Develop a Restorative Evening Routine</span></h5>
<p><strong>Evening Rituals</strong>: End your day with a calming routine that prepares you for restful sleep. This could include gentle stretches, restorative yoga poses like Viparita Karani (Legs-Up-The-Wall Pose), or a guided meditation. Reflect on your day and let go of any tension or stress.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">8. Connect with Nature</span></h5>
<p><strong>Nature Connection</strong>: Spend time outdoors and connect with nature. Whether it&#8217;s a walk in the park, gardening, or simply sitting outside, nature has a grounding and rejuvenating effect. Practice mindfulness by observing the sights, sounds, and sensations around you.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">9. Foster Community and Connection</span></h5>
<p><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Engage with a community that shares your interest in yoga and mindfulness. This could be through yoga classes, workshops, or online forums. Sharing your journey with others can provide support, inspiration, and a sense of belonging.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;">10. Embrace Lifelong Learning</span></h5>
<p><strong>Continual Growth</strong>: Approach yoga as a lifelong journey of growth and learning. Read books on yoga philosophy, attend workshops, and explore different styles and practices. Stay curious and open-minded, and integrate new insights into your daily life.</p>
