        content: "Heather's yoga journey began in 2005 in a corporate midday yoga class. Noticing how much better she was equipped to handle stress in the afternoons than in the mornings, she couldn't ignore the direct correlation to the practice. As Heather continued to practice regularly, the benefits went well beyond stress management and she decided to leave her corporate career of 20 years and dedicate her life to sharing the practice that changed her life with others. She began teaching yoga in 2012 and opened her first studio in 2015. Heather has taught thousands of classes and has led several teacher trainings. Each experience has equipped her with profound learnings and she is grateful for each one. Her mission at Las Olas Yoga and as a yoga instructor is to provide a space and a practice that invites students of all levels on a journey of self-exploration and self-discovery that they can take off the mat to lead a consciously-aware, loving and fulfilled life. Her approach to teaching yoga combines a focus on alignment with the freedom and creativity of a Vinyasa flow in a fun, relaxed environment. Her flow classes are meant to take students off of autopilot to allow them to drop fully into their practice. Her foundations classes are designed to be accessible to first-time students yet creative and unique for long-time students that prefer a slower practice, heavily rooted in alignment. For those that enjoy acronyms, Heather is an E-RYT 500 hour, YACEP certified yoga instructor."
