        content: "Heather's yoga journey began in 2005 in a corporate midday yoga class. Noticing how much better she was equipped to handle stress in the afternoons than in the mornings, she couldn't ignore the direct correlation to the practice. As Heather continued to practice regularly, the benefits went well beyond stress management and she decided to leave her corporate career of 20 years and dedicate her life to sharing the practice that changed her life with others. She began teaching yoga in 2012 and opened her first studio in 2015. Heather has taught thousands of classes and has led several teacher trainings. Each experience has equipped her with profound learnings and she is grateful for each one. Her mission at Las Olas Yoga and as a yoga instructor is to provide a space and a practice that invites students of all levels on a journey of self-exploration and self-discovery that they can take off the mat to lead a consciously-aware, loving and fulfilled life. Her approach to teaching yoga combines a focus on alignment with the freedom and creativity of a Vinyasa flow in a fun, relaxed environment. Her flow classes are meant to take students off of autopilot to allow them to drop fully into their practice. Her foundations classes are designed to be accessible to first-time students yet creative and unique for long-time students that prefer a slower practice, heavily rooted in alignment. For those that enjoy acronyms, Heather is an E-RYT 500 hour, YACEP certified yoga instructor."

Like many others who have found themselves drawn to this ancient practice, Justin’s passion for yoga ignited most when he began to study yogic philosophy. After four years of dedicated practice, he took the leap to become a teacher and leave the corporate world. Justin’s primary interest is in inversions and arm balances, both because they are challenging and also require a focus mind that creates internal stillness. Justin’s teachings reach beyond the physical aspects of yoga and has a strong passion for the subtle ones such as meditation and pranayama. He is a devoted student of yogic philosophy, and continues to see himself as a student, as he travels the world to gain more knowledge. Justin has completed multiple 500-hour yoga teacher trainings, received the FRC mobility certificate, and most recently, completed the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction training."
